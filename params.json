{"name":"SwarmNLP","body":"[Download SwarmNLP](https://github.com/downloads/swax/SwarmNLP/SwarmNLP.zip)\r\n\r\nSwarmNLP is a program for windows that visualizes particle swarm optimization (PSO) over multiple criteria and multiple objectives.  This program is a good teaching tool for showing how PSO runs and quickly visualizing a solution space.\r\n\r\nThe solution space is shown using red shading to display the unfeasible region.  Any number of dimensions can be used with the option of showing a cross-section of any two dimensions. Lighter regions on the screen indicate higher function values.\r\n\r\nObjective functions are not parsed but compiled at runtime into C# code. Check the [System.Math](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.math.aspx) namespace for available functions.\r\n\r\nThere are demo problems included that demonstrate how problems are setup.\r\n ","tagline":"Particle swarm optimization for non-linear programming and multi-criteria problems","google":"UA-30724066-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
