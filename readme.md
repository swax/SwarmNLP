###Swarm NLP 

Uses particle swarm optimization to find approximate solutions to
non-linear programming and multi-criteria decision making problems.

To use:
Enter in one or many objective functions in any number of dimensions.
Enter in your constraints.
Run the swarm until you have an acceptable solution. 

There may be multiple solutions in the non-dominating set, a sample
of these solutions are show as orange dots on the UI.

Options in the UI allow you to view a cross section of any 2 dimensions
for any objective function.

A shaded red region indicates infeasible solutions.
Lighter and darker regions on the screen indicate high and low function values.
